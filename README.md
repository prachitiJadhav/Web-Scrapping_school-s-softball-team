# Web-Scrapping_school-s-softball-team
This project aims to collect the information of players and coaches in a school's softball team using web scraping techniques. The starting point is the roster page of the team website, which is then processed with the BeautifulSoup library to extract relevant information and store it in a structured format. The final output is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary summarizes the information of a single player or coach. The information includes their names, positions, heights, classes, high school, hometown, and for coaches, their title, email, and phone number. The result of the project can be presented in different forms, such as a data frame or a .csv file. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of web scraping to retrieve data from websites and present it in a usable form.
